current state. Instead of updating records in place, you append new events describing what happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Defining Events</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/defining-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/defining-events/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Events represent immutable facts about what happened in your system. They are the building blocks of event sourcing and
capture domain changes as a permanent record.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Querying Events</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/querying-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/querying-events/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Queries define which events should be loaded from the EventStore. They act as dynamic consistency boundaries, allowing
you to load exactly the events needed to make a specific decision. The boundaries are determined at runtime based on the
operation being performed, not predefined at design time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Models</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/building-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/event-sourcing/building-models/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Models are decision-making components that encapsulate domain logic. They are rebuilt from events and record new events
when business rules are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
