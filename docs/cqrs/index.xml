models. Instead of using the same model for both updates and queries, CQRS uses different models optimized for their
specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dispatching Commands</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/dispatching-commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/dispatching-commands/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Commands represent intentions to change the system&amp;rsquo;s state. Unlike events that describe what happened, commands express
what should happen. They carry the information needed to make a business decision and are the entry points for all write
operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reacting with Event Handlers</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/reacting-with-event-handlers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/reacting-with-event-handlers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Event handlers respond to events by updating projections, triggering side effects, or integrating with external systems.
They subscribe to specific event types and execute synchronously when those events are published.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Projections</title><link>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/building-projections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://backslashphp.github.io/backslash/docs/cqrs/building-projections/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Projections are read-optimized views of your system&amp;rsquo;s state. Unlike Models, which are rebuilt from events to make
decisions, projections are designed specifically for querying. They represent the read side of your CQRS architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
