&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding projections is a routine task in event-sourced applications. This capability allows you to reconstruct read
models from scratch by replaying the complete event history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backslash does not provide a built-in component specifically for rebuilding projections; each application has unique
requirements and should implement rebuilding according to its specific needs. However, Backslash provides essential
tools that facilitate the rebuild process, such as the &lt;code&gt;Inspector&lt;/code&gt; for replaying events, the &lt;code&gt;ProjectionStore&lt;/code&gt; for
managing projection lifecycle, and the &lt;code&gt;EventBus&lt;/code&gt; for routing events to projectors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
